It's either converting, compounding, or being completely wasted.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Repair Leads Are Some of the Best Leads</h2> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Too many reps treat repairs like a waste of time. But they're missing the gold.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>ðŸ”§ Repair leads are bleeding.<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
These homeowners aren't "thinking about a new roof someday."<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
They need help right now.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>This is your chance to:</p> <ul data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Be the hero</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Build trust</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Diagnose the real issue</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Offer optionsâ€”not just solutions</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>And if done right, those small repairs? They often turn into:</p> <ul data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Full replacements</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Add-on upgrades</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Maintenance plans</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Referrals to people with bigger problems</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>If someone's calling you for helpâ€”they're not a bad lead. They're your warmest opportunity.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>No One Home? Good. Now Go Be Great.</h2> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>You blocked two hours. You showed up. Nobody answers.<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
Some reps get frustrated and head home.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>But champions flip the script.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>This is your RGB windowâ€”your time for Revenue Generating Behaviors.</p> <ul data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>ðŸŽ¯ Knock 6â€“12 nearby doors</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>ðŸŽ¯ Drop flyers or door hangers</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>ðŸŽ¯ Ask neighbors if they've noticed roof issues</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>ðŸŽ¯ Say: "I was supposed to meet with your neighbor at 214, but while I'm hereâ€¦"</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Ohâ€”and the lead you were supposed to meet?<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
They might pull in the driveway while you're working the block.<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
Now they see hustle. They see professionalism. They see credibility.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Every "no-show" is a stage. You just have to step up and perform.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Companies Must Hold Sales Reps Accountable for Every Lead</h2> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>A lead isn't free.<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
It's not a favor.<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
It's an investmentâ€”and a costly one.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Between digital ads, office admin, tech platforms, marketing costs, call center routing, and CRM overhead, a single lead can cost $250â€“$450+ just to book.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>And when a rep writes it off as "not worth my time"?<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
You don't just lose a leadâ€”you lose margin, momentum, and culture.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>This is why every company should:</p> <ul data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>âœ… Track lead costs</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>âœ… Train reps on the value of every opportunity</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>âœ… Hold the team accountable for activity, not just outcomes</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>âœ… Require reps to engage every appointment with a service-first mindset</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>If you only celebrate the closes and not the effort, you'll build a team that chases comfortâ€”not consistency.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Every sales rep should be reminded:<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
"You were given this lead because we believed you could help that homeowner. Show us you believe that too."</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>You Don't Just Sell Roofsâ€”You Create Moments of Trust</h2> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>If the homeowner doesn't buy today, that doesn't mean the moment didn't matter.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Your brand is being built:</p> <ul data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>On how you show up</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>On what you educate them on</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>On how you make them feelâ€”even if they say no</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>This isn't about closing deals.<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
This is about building something so trusted, so consistent, and so community-driven that people start calling you before the storm even hits.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Bad leads don't exist. But wasted impressions? Those cost more than most companies realize.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Final Thought: Leads Don't Failâ€”People Just Don't Show Up for Them</h2> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>There's no such thing as a bad leadâ€”just an untrained eye that doesn't see the opportunity in front of them.</p> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Here's your new mindset:</p> <ul data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Every repair is a relationship</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Every no-show is a neighborhood</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Every appointment is a chance to make an impression</li> <li data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>Every lead has a costâ€”and deserves respect</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>At Day 41 Thrive, we train leaders and teams to treat every lead like goldâ€”because that's what it costs.<br data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w>
And when your team starts acting like every appointment is an opportunity to earn, serve, and multiplyâ€”you stop surviving and start thriving.</p> ${renderComponent($$result2, "BlogContactCTA", $$BlogContactCTA, { "data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w": true })} </div> </article> </main> ${renderComponent($$result2, "FloatingActionButton", $$FloatingActionButton, { "data-astro-cid-mg5oia4w": true })} ` })} `;
