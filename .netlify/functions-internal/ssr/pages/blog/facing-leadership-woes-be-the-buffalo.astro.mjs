If it were easy, everyone would be doing it. Instead, leadership is a relentless storm—filled with challenges, tough decisions, and moments that make you question why you ever signed up for this in the first place.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>But the best leaders don't avoid the storm. They don't wait for it to pass or try to outrun it. They run straight into it.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>If you've ever felt overwhelmed, burned out, or just plain tired of carrying the weight of leadership, this is for you. Let's talk about why being the buffalo—charging headfirst into the storm—is the best way to deal with leadership woes and come out stronger on the other side.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The Leadership Storms No One Warns You About</h2> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>When you first step into leadership, no one tells you about the storms ahead. They talk about the power, the influence, the ability to inspire others. But they rarely mention:</p> <ul data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The loneliness of leadership—when you realize that not every decision will make you popular.</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The weight of responsibility—when every failure feels personal, and every success feels fleeting.</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The unpredictability of people—when your best team members surprise you in the worst ways.</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The exhaustion of always having to be "on"—when you just want a break, but everyone is looking to you for answers.</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Every leader will face these storms at some point. The question isn't if they'll come, but how you'll handle them when they do.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Why Most People Avoid the Storm</h2> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>It's human nature to avoid discomfort. When a storm rolls in, most people do what makes sense—they turn and run the other way. They delay hard conversations, push off difficult decisions, or distract themselves with busy work instead of tackling problems head-on.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>In leadership, avoidance only makes the storm last longer.</p> <ul data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Ignoring small team conflicts? They turn into major divisions.</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Postponing a difficult decision? It only becomes harder with time.</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Avoiding change? You'll get left behind.</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Cattle, when faced with a storm, do the same thing—they run away from it. But in doing so, they end up staying in the storm much longer than necessary.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Buffalo, on the other hand, do something remarkable.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>They run straight into the storm because they know that by charging through it, they will get to the other side faster.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Leading Like a Buffalo: Running Into the Storm</h2> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>If you want to lead well, you have to stop running from the storm. You have to be the buffalo.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Here's what that looks like in leadership:</p> <ol data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <strong data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Confronting Problems Early</strong><br data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>
Hard conversations don't get easier with time. Address performance issues, miscommunication, and strategic misalignment now, not later.
</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <strong data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Making the Tough Calls</strong><br data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>
Leadership isn't a popularity contest. Sometimes the right decision is the hardest one. Make the call, stand by it, and own the outcome.
</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <strong data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Embracing Change Instead of Resisting It</strong><br data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>
Every industry evolves. The leaders who thrive aren't the ones clinging to the past but the ones running headfirst into innovation and adaptation.
</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <strong data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Owning Your Mistakes</strong><br data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>
Storms reveal character. When you mess up, take full ownership, learn from it, and move forward. Leaders who shift blame or avoid accountability only create bigger storms.
</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <strong data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Staying Resilient When Others Are Losing It</strong><br data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>
Your team is watching how you handle adversity. If you panic, they'll panic. If you stand firm and push through, they'll follow your lead.
</li> </ol> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Being the buffalo means running toward the thing that scares you most, knowing that pushing through the storm is the only way to reach the sun on the other side.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>What Happens When You Stop Avoiding the Storm</h2> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The beauty of running into the storm is that, eventually, you come out of it. And when you do, you realize:</p> <ul data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The hard conversation wasn't as bad as you imagined.</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The difficult decision brought clarity and progress.</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The change you resisted actually led to new opportunities.</li> <li data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The thing that felt overwhelming is now just a lesson you carry forward.</li> </ul> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Leaders who face storms head-on develop unshakable confidence. They earn the trust of their teams. They build a culture of resilience. And most importantly, they stop letting fear dictate their decisions.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Day 41 Stories: A Leadership Storm I'll Never Forget</h2> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Early in my leadership journey, I made a mistake that still sticks with me. I avoided making a hard decision because I didn't want to upset anyone. I knew something wasn't working, but I convinced myself that waiting it out was better than taking action.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>The storm built slowly at first. Small frustrations turned into resentment. Productivity declined. What could have been a quick storm to run through became a months-long problem because I hesitated.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>When I finally made the call—when I finally faced the storm—I realized I had wasted so much time worrying about it instead of just dealing with it. From that moment on, I promised myself I'd never let fear dictate my leadership decisions again. I would be the buffalo.</p> <h2 data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Conclusion</h2> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Every leader will face storms. Some will run from them. Others will stand still, hoping they'll pass. But the best leaders? They run straight into them.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>They embrace the discomfort. They make the tough calls. They lean into the chaos, knowing that it's the only way to grow.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>If you're in a storm right now, stop running. Face it. Own it. Push through it. Because on the other side is clarity, strength, and the kind of leadership that sets you apart.</p> <p data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn>Be the buffalo.</p> ${renderComponent($$result2, "BlogContactCTA", $$BlogContactCTA, { "data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn": true })} </div> </article> </main> ${renderComponent($$result2, "FloatingActionButton", $$FloatingActionButton, { "data-astro-cid-uwp3bldn": true })} ` })} `;
