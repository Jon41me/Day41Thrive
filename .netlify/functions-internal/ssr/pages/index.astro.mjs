You're either heading into it, navigating through it, or emerging from it. At Day 41 Thrive, we're inspired by the buffalo, which runs directly into storms rather than avoiding them.</p> <p data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p>Our name, Day 41 Thrive, represents the mindset that the storm is temporary, and thriving starts the moment you decide to move forward with courage and purpose.</p> <div class="founders-section" data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p> <h3 data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p>Meet the Founders</h3> <p class="founders-intro" data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p>At Day 41 Thrive, our mission is inspired by the personal journeys, leadership expertise, and shared vision of our founders, Jonathon Broce, Jeff Valder, and Teresa Hire Reyes. Together, they empower leaders and businesses to face challenges head-on and achieve transformative growth.</p> <div class="founders-grid" data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p> <div class="founder-card" data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p> <h4 data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p><a href="https://jonathonbroce.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p>Jonathon Broce</a></h4> <p data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p>Jonathon Broce's story is one of resilience, hard work, and faith.

Born with physical disabilities and a speech impediment, Jon spent his early years in casts and therapy, eventually developing a determination to tackle life's storms head-on.

He scaled and sold a spec home construction company, helped multiple roofing companies grow from mid-sized to multi-million-dollar enterprises, and co-founded a successful roof and exterior cleaning business before selling it. As a co-owner of MHI Roofing, he played a key role in its growth before selling to Vertex Service Partners, where he later served as Florida Region COO. Known for transforming businesses and developing high-performing teams, Jon believes there are no problems—only unsolved opportunities.</p> <p data-astro-cid-v2cbyr3p>Now, as CEO of Day 41 Thrive, he brings his 25 plus years of business experience and is dedicated to helping other leaders grow and thrive. He also co-owns Ugly Roof and System Thrive and recently founded Sure Home Pros, a tech-driven platform revolutionizing how homeowners find and book home services.
