            <p>Life is a storm. You're either heading into it, navigating through it, or emerging from it. At Day 41 Thrive, we're inspired by the buffalo, which runs directly into storms rather than avoiding them.</p>
            <p>Our name, Day 41 Thrive, represents the mindset that the storm is temporary, and thriving starts the moment you decide to move forward with courage and purpose.</p>

                <h3>Meet the Founders</h3>

                        <h4><a href="https://jonathonbroce.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathon Broce</a></h4>
                        <p>Jonathon Broce's story is one of resilience, hard work, and faith. Born and raised in Cabell County, West Virginia, Jon grew up immersed in the values of simplicity and determination. His family's legacy in the roofing industry, including his great-grandfather's work applying the gold leaf to the Capitol in Charleston, WV, instilled a deep appreciation for craftsmanship and dedication.</p>
                        <p>Jon's life has been shaped by overcoming challenges. Born with physical disabilities and a speech impediment, Jon spent his early years in casts and therapy, eventually developing a determination to tackle life's storms head-on. Whether baling hay on the farm, serving in the Marine Corps, or excelling in business, Jon exemplifies the buffalo's mindset: running into the storm rather than away from it.</p>
                        <p>Jon has built a career in roofing and construction, excelling in sales, leadership, and business development. He scaled and sold a spec home construction company, helped multiple roofing companies grow from mid-sized to multi-million-dollar enterprises, and co-founded a successful roof and exterior cleaning business before selling it. As a co-owner of MHI Roofing, he played a key role in its growth before selling to Vertex Service Partners, where he later served as Florida Region COO. Known for transforming businesses and developing high-performing teams, Jon believes there are no problems—only unsolved opportunities.</p>
                        <p>Now, as CEO of Day 41 Thrive, he brings his 25 plus years of business experience and is dedicated to helping other leaders grow and thrive. He also co-owns Ugly Roof and System Thrive and recently founded Sure Home Pros, a tech-driven platform revolutionizing how homeowners find and book home services. At Day 41 Thrive, Jon is passionate about helping leaders grow, thrive, and create extraordinary results for their teams and organizations.</p>

                <h3>WHY DAY 41 THRIVE?</h3>
                <p class="section-subtitle">Day 41 Thrive: Helping Contractors Build, Scale & Thrive</p>
                
                <div class="power-of-41">
                    <h4>The Power of 41</h4>
                    <p>In scripture, 40 represents testing and trials—but Day 41 brings breakthrough and new beginnings.</p>
                    <p>At Day 41 Thrive, we believe business is a storm—and most leaders face their toughest trials for what feels like 40 days (or years). The difference between failure and success is whether you persevere long enough to reach Day 41—the moment when challenges turn into opportunities, teams transform, and businesses scale sustainably.</p>
                    <p>We help contractors navigate that journey—so they don't give up at 40 but instead build businesses that thrive beyond the storm.</p>

                <div class="biblical-truths">
                    <h4>Biblical Truths That Define Day 41</h4>
                    <p>In scripture, 40 represents testing, trials, and waiting, but Day 41 is when breakthroughs happen—the rain stops, the giant falls, and the promised land is reached. Whether it was Noah, Moses, David, Jonah, or Jesus, their trials lasted 40 days or years, but on Day 41, everything changed.</p>
                </div>
