                    <h2>Explore the Strategy</h2>
                    <p>At DAY 41 THRIVE, we teach contractors how to use repair services as a strategic entry point while transitioning homeowners toward full roof replacements. Most homeowners prefer to fix rather than replace due to cost concerns and anxiety about large-scale projects. However, only about 25% of roofs are truly repairable, making the transition to replacement the natural next step when handled correctly.</p>

                <p class="section-intro">Many contractors struggle to sell replacements upfront, but repairs provide a non-threatening way to build trust and open the conversation. The key is to position the repair as an opportunity for a full roof and attic inspection, allowing you to educate the homeowner on the long-term risks and benefits of a full replacement.</p>
