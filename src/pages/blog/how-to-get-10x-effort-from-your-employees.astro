                <h2>Introduction: Stop Expecting More—Start Unlocking It</h2>
                <p>Here's a hard truth most leaders don't want to say out loud:</p>
                
                <p>Most employees aren't giving 100%.<br>
                They're giving just enough not to get fired.</p>
                
                <p>If you're lucky, they're at a 1x output—meeting expectations, checking boxes, doing their "job."</p>
                
                <p>But the goal isn't compliance.<br>
                The goal is commitment.</p>
                
                <p>At Day 41 Thrive, and in Don't GUESS, Thrive Through Storms, we teach leaders how to unlock effort, not demand it—because people don't go 10x for companies.<br>
                They go 10x for leaders who believe in them and show them the way.</p>
                
                <p>Here's how to shift from transactional output to transformational effort.</p>

                <h2>1. Know the Real Starting Line: &lt;1x Effort Is Normal</h2>
                <p>Most leaders assume people start at 1x effort.<br>
                But the reality? Most start at 0.8x—just doing the basics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Punching in on time</li>
                    <li>Avoiding big mistakes</li>
                    <li>Responding only when asked</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Why? Because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They're not bought in</li>
                    <li>They don't know the "why"</li>
                    <li>No one's ever led them past average</li>
                </ul>

                <p>That's not laziness. That's leadership waiting to happen.</p>
                
                <p>You don't raise effort with pressure. You raise it with purpose.</p>

                <h2>2. Activate Identity Before You Expect Performance</h2>
                <p>From Don't GUESS, Thrive Through Storms:</p>
                
                <p>"You can't grow someone into the next level if they don't see themselves there."</p>
                
                <p>If someone only sees themselves as a laborer, don't expect them to think like a leader.</p>

                <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do they know the mission they're a part of?</li>
                    <li>Do they know how their role creates impact?</li>
                    <li>Do they feel trusted to grow?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When you activate identity, you unlock effort.<br>
                People rise to the level of how you see them—and remind them.</p>

                <h2>3. Turn Effort Into Ownership with the G.U.E.S.S. Framework</h2>
                <p>From the G.U.E.S.S. model:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GROW: Self-reflect, expand, evolve, develop</li>
                    <li>UNLEASH: Recognize, inspire, support, empower</li>
                    <li>ENHANCE: Focus, leverage, optimize, work smart</li>
                    <li>STRATEGIZE: Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound</li>
                    <li>SYNCHRONIZE: Trust, engage, align, mobilize</li>
                </ul>

                <p>10x effort doesn't come from hype.<br>
                It comes from structure that guides performance and belief that fuels it.</p>
                
                <p>You're not just trying to manage effort.<br>
                You're shaping it—one clear step at a time.</p>
                
                <p>You're not building employees. You're building champions.</p>

                <h2>4. Create a Culture of Safe Stretching</h2>
                <p>You want 10x effort?<br>
                Give people safe spaces to fail and grow.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reward initiative, not just results</li>
                    <li>Celebrate effort, not just output</li>
                    <li>Review decisions, not just mistakes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>People don't fear effort.<br>
                They fear looking dumb, being punished, or getting left behind.</p>
                
                <p>Build a culture where trying hard is the expectation, not the exception.</p>

                <h2>5. Respect That They'll Never Be You (And That's a Good Thing)</h2>
                <p>Here's something every founder and leader needs to hear:</p>
                
                <p>No employee will ever be you.<br>
                And they shouldn't be.</p>
                
                <p>They didn't risk everything. They don't wake up at 3AM thinking about payroll.<br>
                They aren't obsessed with the mission—and that's okay.</p>

                <p>Your team should be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Work hard from 9 to 5</li>
                    <li>Clock out without guilt</li>
                    <li>Go home and be with their family</li>
                </ul>

                <p>So stop:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sending late-night texts</li>
                    <li>Shooting off early-morning emails</li>
                    <li>Expecting them to live and breathe the business</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You'll burn them out.</p>
                
                <p>When people are trusted, protected, and given margin, effort multiplies.</p>
                
                <p>Create a culture where people are allowed to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try and fail</li>
                    <li>Log off on time</li>
                    <li>Be human</li>
                </ul>

                <p>And most importantly, set boundaries and stick to them.<br>
                If you want high performance, model sustainable leadership.</p>

                <h2>6. Incentivize Behavior, Not Just Results</h2>
                <p>Most companies reward production and sales only.</p>
                
                <p>But if you want to build a 10x culture:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognize problem-solvers</li>
                    <li>Celebrate teammates who support others</li>
                    <li>Reward great communication and ownership</li>
                </ul>

                <p>"We don't just value what you do. We value how you show up."</p>

                <h2>7. Multiply What's Working</h2>
                <p>Find your 2x, 3x, and 5x players—and figure out what they're doing differently.</p>

                <p>Then:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Share their stories</li>
                    <li>Create teachable moments</li>
                    <li>Turn habits into systems</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Effort is contagious. Shine the spotlight on it.</p>

                <h2>Final Thought: You Don't Need Clones. You Need Champions.</h2>
                <p>If you're expecting your team to care like the founder, you're setting them up to fail.</p>

                <p>But if you give them the tools, the trust, and the training—they'll give you more than compliance.<br>
                They'll give you commitment.</p>
                
                <p>Effort multiplies in cultures that are clear, kind, and consistent.</p>
                
                <p>So:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Train with purpose</li>
                    <li>Lead with trust</li>
                    <li>Honor their time</li>
                    <li>Stop measuring value by who "acts like the owner"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is how you build teams that thrive through storms—without burning out in them.</p>
