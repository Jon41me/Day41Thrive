                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>If you spend enough time in the roofing industry, you'll notice something—everyone thinks they're a guru. Social media is flooded with self-proclaimed "experts," coaching programs pop up daily, and advice flows freely from people who claim to have all the answers.</p>
                
                <p>But here's the thing: real industry leaders aren't the ones shouting the loudest. They're the ones doing the work, building businesses, growing teams, and proving their value through action—not self-promotion.</p>
                
                <p>At Day 41 Thrive, we believe in something more than just talking about success—we believe in earning it, proving it, and sharing it with others.</p>
                
                <p>So, how do you separate those who are just talking about roofing from those who have truly lived it? Here's what to look for before engaging with anyone who claims to be a roofing industry expert.</p>

                <h2>The Questions You Should Be Asking</h2>
                <p>If you're considering working with someone—whether it's a consultant, coach, or partner in the roofing space—don't just take their word for it. Ask the hard questions. Their answers will tell you everything you need to know.</p>

                <h3>1. Have They Owned and Operated Their Own Roofing Company?</h3>
                <p>Anyone can study the roofing industry, but have they actually built a business from the ground up? Have they felt the pressure of payroll, managed production crews, and dealt with customers face-to-face?</p>
                
                <p>It's easy to coach from the sidelines. It's another thing entirely to have been in the trenches—closing deals, solving problems, and making the tough calls.</p>

                <h3>2. Have They Scaled Multiple Companies to $15 Million+ Organically?</h3>
                <p>Growth isn't just about revenue—it's about sustainable, organic growth.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have they built multiple companies to over $15 million in revenue?</li>
                    <li>Did they do it through strong leadership, operational efficiency, and team development—or did they rely on unsustainable methods?</li>
                    <li>Can they replicate their success, or was it a one-time fluke?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Scaling a business isn't about luck—it's about proven systems, leadership, and strategic execution.</p>

                <h3>3. Are They Giving More to the Community Than They Are Taking?</h3>
                <p>A real industry leader isn't just focused on what they can gain—they're focused on what they can give.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do they share knowledge freely, or do they only help when there's money involved?</li>
                    <li>Have they contributed to industry growth, trained future leaders, or given back to their community?</li>
                    <li>Are they helping others succeed, or just focused on making a name for themselves?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Real leadership is about impact, not ego.</p>

                <h3>4. Do They Have 20+ Years of Roofing Experience?</h3>
                <p>The roofing industry is filled with cycles—good years, bad years, economic downturns, shifting regulations, and changing customer expectations.</p>
                
                <p>Someone who has been in the game for decades has seen it all and knows how to navigate challenges without shortcuts. Experience isn't just about longevity—it's about lessons learned, problems solved, and wisdom gained through trial and error.</p>

                <h3>5. Do They Admit They Have Failures?</h3>
                <p>If someone tells you they've never failed, run in the other direction.</p>
                
                <p>Failure isn't a weakness—it's proof that someone has taken real risks, pushed limits, and learned valuable lessons. The best roofing leaders aren't afraid to talk about their mistakes because they use them as teaching moments for others.</p>
                
                <p>If all someone does is talk about their wins, they're selling a fantasy. Look for people who are honest about the struggles and how they overcame them.</p>

                <h3>6. Do They Work Hard Without Self-Promotion?</h3>
                <p>There's a big difference between marketing your expertise and constantly seeking attention.</p>
                
                <p>True leaders let their results, teams, and contributions to the industry speak for themselves. They don't need to be in the spotlight 24/7 because their work already proves their credibility.</p>
                
                <p>If someone's feed is all about them, and not about the people they've helped, ask yourself—who are they really serving?</p>

                <h3>7. Do They Focus on Building Teams Instead of Just Their Own Wealth?</h3>
                <p>Great leaders don't just build businesses—they build people.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are they teaching and developing the next generation of roofing professionals?</li>
                    <li>Do they invest in growing strong teams, or is their business just a one-person show?</li>
                    <li>Do they believe in serving others first, or are they just focused on their own success?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If someone's only goal is stacking cash, they're not building anything that will outlast them. True leaders leave legacies, not just profits.</p>

                <h3>8. Are They Truly Kind, Helpful, and Committed to the Industry?</h3>
                <p>This one might sound simple, but it's one of the most important.</p>
                
                <p>Real leadership isn't just about being knowledgeable—it's about how you treat people. The best leaders are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Approachable and generous with their time.</li>
                    <li>Willing to help others without expecting something in return.</li>
                    <li>Respected by their peers—not just followed on social media.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A true roofing expert should be someone people want to work with not just because of their knowledge, but because of their character.</p>

                <h3>9. Have They Actually Sold Their Roofing Company?</h3>
                <p>This is the ultimate proof of success.</p>
                
                <p>Building a company is one thing—creating a business valuable enough to sell is another. If someone has successfully scaled, structured, and exited a roofing company, it means they:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built something bigger than themselves.</li>
                    <li>Developed real, long-term strategies that created value.</li>
                    <li>Know how to create a business that runs without them.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Anyone can start a business. Fewer can make it profitable and sustainable. Even fewer can sell it for a real return. That's the level of expertise you want to learn from.</p>
