                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In today's roofing industry, the competition is fierce. Private equity-backed companies are pouring millions into digital marketing, dominating Google Ads, Local Service Ads (LSAs), SEO, and lead aggregators like Angi's and Modernize. For smaller to mid-sized roofing businesses, trying to outspend these giants is a losing battle.</p>
                
                <p>But what if you don't have to outspend them? What if you could outwork and outsmart them instead?</p>
                
                <p>At Day 41 Thrive, we've developed a proven system that turns one job into many through a hyper-local marketing strategy called the Profit Multiplier Formula. This omni-local approach combines canvassing, branding, direct mail, and digital advertising into a powerful formula that drives high-quality leads at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing.</p>
                
                <p>Here's how it works.</p>

                <h2>The One-Mile Pin Strategy: Maximizing Every Job Site</h2>
                <p>Instead of casting a wide, expensive net across an entire market, the One-Mile Pin Strategy focuses on dominating the immediate neighborhood around every job site.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Key Tactics:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>6, 12, and 24 Pack Canvassing</li>
                    <li>Strategic Branding (Yard Signs, Truck Wraps, and Facebook Ads)</li>
                    <li>Automated Direct Mail Campaigns</li>
                    <li>Tracking and Lead Conversion through Canvassing Tools</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Each piece of the strategy works together to create omnipresence—so that every potential customer in the area sees, hears, and engages with your brand multiple times.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: The 6, 12, and 24 Pack Canvassing System</h2>
                <p>Every appointment, every build, and every completed job should lead to more opportunities. The key to making that happen is a structured, repeatable canvassing approach.</p>

                <h3>6 Pack – Pre-Appointment Knock</h3>
                <p>Before meeting with a homeowner, the sales rep knocks on the six closest doors. The script is simple:</p>
                <blockquote>"Hey, I'm meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Smith about their roof. Just wanted to make sure I'm parked okay."</blockquote>
                <p>This soft touch creates instant recognition and builds rapport with neighbors before the job even begins.</p>

                <h3>12 Pack – Pre-Construction Notice</h3>
                <p>Once the job is sold, the team hits the 12 closest houses to let them know work is starting soon:</p>
                <blockquote>"We'll be working at the Smiths' home. If you get a shingle wrapper in your yard or a truck turns around in your driveway, just let us know."</blockquote>
                <p>This positions your team as professional and considerate while increasing brand awareness.</p>

                <h3>24 Pack – Build Day Blitz</h3>
                <p>The day the job starts, your team executes a two-step canvassing plan:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Morning: Hang door hangers on all homes in the surrounding area.</li>
                    <li>Afternoon: Revisit and knock on doors where the hangers are gone—because those homeowners are likely home.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By timing the face-to-face engagement for when people are most likely home, you maximize conversation rates.</p>

                <h2>Step 2: Branding That Creates Instant Recognition</h2>
                <p>To truly dominate an area, people need to see your brand everywhere.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yard Signs – Standard practice, but don't just place one sign. Place multiple at strategic intersections nearby.</li>
                    <li>Truck Wraps – Ensure your team vehicles look professional and uniform, reinforcing your brand at every job site.</li>
                    <li>Facebook Ads – Instead of lead generation, use ads for branding and community engagement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step 3: Facebook Ads That Support Canvassing (Not Just Lead Gen)</h2>
                <p>Most contractors run Facebook ads the wrong way. The goal shouldn't just be generating direct leads—it should be about branding and reinforcement.</p>

                <p>Here's the right approach:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pin the Job Address & Run a 1-Mile Radius Ad for 60 Days</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This keeps your company in front of the same audience while they see your physical presence.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use Pre-Made Video & Content Ads</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid the "Call Now for a Discount" approach.</li>
                            <li>Instead, post culture-driven content like:</li>
                            <li>Meet the Crew</li>
                            <li>Installation Videos</li>
                            <li>Community Events</li>
                            <li>"How to Spot a Bad Contractor"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Keep the Budget Lean But Effective</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allocate $20-$30 per job (roughly $1,500-$2,000 per month for 100 jobs).</li>
                            <li>This small investment creates a huge local impact.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>By combining physical presence (yard signs, canvassing, and trucks) with digital presence (targeted ads), you create the illusion of a much bigger company—even if you're only doing a few jobs per week in that area.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Direct Mail That Reinforces Your Brand</h2>
                <p>To further support canvassing and Facebook ads, automated direct mail campaigns should be scheduled before and after the job is completed.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>"We'll Be in the Neighborhood" Postcard (Sent Before Build Date)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sent to 25-50 nearby homes</li>
                            <li>Establishes awareness before canvassing starts</li>
                            <li>Includes friendly messaging, not aggressive sales tactics</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>"Pardon Our Dust" Postcard (Sent 3 Days Before Build Day)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lets homeowners know your company is working nearby</li>
                            <li>Reinforces your commitment to professionalism</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Post-Build Follow-Up Postcard</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sent 1-2 weeks after completion</li>
                            <li>Encourages referrals and reviews</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>This three-step direct mail sequence ensures homeowners in the neighborhood hear about your company multiple times.</p>

                <h2>Step 5: Tracking and Optimizing the Process</h2>
                <p>A great strategy is only effective if it's tracked and optimized.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use LeadScout or Similar Apps to track door knocks, response rates, and conversions.</li>
                    <li>Compensate Canvassing Teams Based on Performance using referral tracking tools.</li>
                    <li>Monitor Facebook Ad Engagement and adjust creative content as needed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With these tracking measures in place, you can continually refine the process to increase lead generation and conversion rates.</p>

                <h2>The Results: Higher Lead Volume, Lower Marketing Costs</h2>
                <p>By implementing the Profit Multiplier Formula, you can expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3% neighborhood conversion rate (for every 100 houses targeted, 3 appointments booked)</li>
                    <li>1 additional sale per every 100 houses canvassed</li>
                    <li>Marketing cost reduced to 3-4% per campaign</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Compared to traditional marketing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Competing companies spend 10-20% of revenue on marketing.</li>
                    <li>This strategy keeps total marketing costs at 6-7%, improving profit margins and scalability.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is the same approach we used to scale a roofing company from $4M to $17M before acquisition, while keeping blended marketing costs at 7% or lower.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion: Outwork, Outsmart, and Own Your Market</h2>
                <p>The Profit Multiplier Formula isn't about competing in a digital arms race. It's about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being in more places at more times</li>
                    <li>Leveraging smart local marketing instead of overspending on ads</li>
                    <li>Creating a system that takes one job and turns it into many</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While larger companies throw money at marketing, you outwork them with strategy and effort.</p>

                <p>If you're ready to scale while keeping marketing costs low, the One-Mile Pin Strategy is the way to win.</p>
