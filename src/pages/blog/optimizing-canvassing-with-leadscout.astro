                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Canvassing has long been one of the most effective ways to generate leads in the roofing industry. But in today's fast-paced market, knocking on doors without a strategy is just wasting time.</p>

                <p>At Day 41 Thrive, we've developed a proven canvassing system that combines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>âœ… Lead Scout for tracking and optimizing efforts</li>
                    <li>âœ… The Profit Multiplier Formula for maximizing job site marketing</li>
                    <li>âœ… A structured approach to warm and cold knocking</li>
                    <li>âœ… Postcard drip campaigns to nurture leads that don't convert immediately</li>
                    <li>âœ… Seamless integration with Get The Referral (GTR) for easy lead payouts</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With the right canvassing team and technology stack, one canvasser should be able to generate $1.5 million per year in sales. Here's exactly how we do it.</p>

                <h2>Setting Expectations: The Canvassing Math That Makes Millions</h2>
                <p>One full-time canvasser, when trained and managed properly, should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Knock 100 doors per day</li>
                    <li>Schedule 4 appointments per day</li>
                    <li>Deliver 3 proposals per day</li>
                    <li>Close 1 sale per day</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If the average job ticket is $15,000, that means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ðŸ“Œ $75,000 in new sales per week</li>
                    <li>ðŸ“Œ $1.5 million in sales per year</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With these numbers in mind, let's break down the exact canvassing process and technology that makes this possible.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Using Lead Scout to Track & Optimize Canvassing</h2>
                <p>Lead Scout is the backbone of our canvassing operation because it allows us to track and optimize every knock.</p>

                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>âœ… Accurate Homeowner Data â€“ Lead Scout pins the correct home, address, and homeowner info.</li>
                    <li>âœ… Automated Tracking â€“ Canvassers pin every house they knock on and categorize the result:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hot Lead (Booked appointment)</li>
                            <li>Not Home (Needs follow-up)</li>
                            <li>No Interest (Will drip with postcards)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>âœ… Specialty Tags for Future Marketing â€“ If a homeowner isn't interested, we tag them in Lead Scout and trigger automated postcard campaigns through Dope Marketing or SendGym.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why It Works:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every door-knocking session is tracked and optimized</li>
                    <li>Canvassers stay accountable and follow up on warm leads</li>
                    <li>Non-converting leads enter a marketing funnel instead of being wasted</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step 2: The Warm Canvassing Approach (One-Mile Pin Strategy)</h2>
                <p>Warm canvassing focuses on knocking doors around existing or upcoming projects using a simple service-based approach.</p>

                <h3>ðŸ‘· Step 1: Work Within the One-Mile Pin Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Knock doors one week before the job starts, during the build, and up to two weeks after completion.</li>
                    <li>Let neighbors know you're working in the areaâ€”name-drop the homeowner's name for credibility.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ðŸ’¬ Step 2: The "Shingle Wrapper" Opener</h3>
                <blockquote>"Hey, we just finished a job for Mr. Smith down the street. We wanted to check your backyard to make sure no shingle wrappers or debris blew in. Would that be okay?"</blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>This drops their guard because it's a customer service approach, not a hard sell.</li>
                    <li>Once invited in, build rapport using FORM (Family, Occupation, Recreation, Motivation).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Step 3: Set the Appointment Using the "This or That" Approach</h3>
                <p>Instead of asking, "When would you like an appointment?"</p>
                <p>Use choice-based scheduling:</p>
                <blockquote>"I have Tuesday at 3 or Thursday at 4. Which works better?"</blockquote>
                <p>This keeps scheduling simple and effective.</p>

                <h2>Step 3: The Cold Canvassing Approach (Am I Parked Okay?)</h2>
                <p>For cold doors (homes outside a job area), we use the "Am I Parked Okay?" method:</p>

                <h3>ðŸš— Step 1: Park In Front of Their House & Knock the Door</h3>
                <h3>ðŸ’¬ Step 2: Opener Script:</h3>
                <blockquote>"Hey, I'm getting ready to meet with a homeowner down the street and wanted to make sure my truck isn't in the way. Am I parked okay?"</blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>This feels natural and non-intrusive, avoiding the typical salesperson rejection.</li>
                    <li>It creates an opening for a friendly conversation.</li>
                    <li>If they engage, pivot into the roofing discussion naturally.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This low-pressure, conversational approach dramatically increases engagement.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Automating Follow-Ups with Postcards & Digital Ads</h2>
                <p>When a homeowner isn't home or isn't immediately interested, we don't let that lead die. Instead, we tag them in Lead Scout and trigger a 4-7 postcard drip campaign.</p>

                <h3>The Process:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Tag the Homeowner in Lead Scout</li>
                    <li>ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Trigger Postcards via Dope Marketing or SendGym</li>
                    <li>ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Homeowner Receives 4-7 Touchpoints Over Several Weeks</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Postcard Sequence:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>âœ… Postcard 1: "We Just Worked on a Home in Your Neighborhood"</li>
                    <li>âœ… Postcard 2: "Here's What Your Neighbors Are Saying About Our Work"</li>
                    <li>âœ… Postcard 3: "Look for Signs of Roof Damage Before the Next Storm"</li>
                    <li>âœ… Postcard 4: "Last Chance: Get a Free Roof Inspection This Month"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Works:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeps your company top-of-mind long after the canvasser leaves.</li>
                    <li>Warms up cold leads who might not have been ready at the time.</li>
                    <li>Creates a steady flow of inbound calls and web leads from past canvassing efforts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step 5: Paying & Tracking Canvassers Using Get The Referral (GTR)</h2>
                <p>Instead of handling complex payroll structures, we pay canvassers through the Get The Referral (GTR) app:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>âœ… $25 per completed proposal (not just for setting an appointment)</li>
                    <li>âœ… $175 per sold job</li>
                    <li>âœ… $300 bonus for every 3 jobs sold</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Track It:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All appointments and sales are entered into Lead Scout</li>
                    <li>GTR tracks payouts and incentives automatically</li>
                    <li>No need for complex manual commission tracking</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This creates transparency, accountability, and motivation for canvassers.</p>

                <h2>Step 6: Scaling the Process for Higher Revenue</h2>
                <p>When combined with our Profit Multiplier Formula, this canvassing process creates a self-sustaining pipeline of leads.</p>

                <h3>ðŸ’° Results Per Canvasser Per Year</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>ðŸ“Œ 100 doors/day â†’ 4 appointments/day</li>
                    <li>ðŸ“Œ 3 proposals/day â†’ 1 sale/day</li>
                    <li>ðŸ“Œ $75,000/week â†’ $1.5M/year in new sales</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Works So Well:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>âœ… Lead Scout ensures data accuracy and tracks every knock.</li>
                    <li>âœ… Postcard campaigns nurture leads that weren't home or weren't ready.</li>
                    <li>âœ… Get The Referral (GTR) ensures seamless payment tracking.</li>
                    <li>âœ… The warm and cold canvassing scripts reduce rejection and increase conversions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This entire strategy ensures that no lead is wasted, marketing costs remain low, and every job site generates additional revenue.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion: The Future of Canvassing is Data-Driven</h2>
                <p>In the past, canvassing was random, inconsistent, and difficult to track. But with the right toolsâ€”Lead Scout, automated postcard campaigns, and Get The Referralâ€”canvassing becomes a scalable, profitable strategy that fuels long-term business growth.</p>

                <p>At Day 41 Thrive, we've tested, refined, and scaled this approachâ€”and we've seen it drive millions in revenue.</p>

                <p>If you want to turn every canvassing effort into a revenue-generating machine, this is how you do it.</p>
